# Potato-Disease-Classification
>Dataset Download: First, we download the dataset containing images of various potato diseases from Kaggle using the OpenDatasets library. This dataset is essential for training our disease classification model.
>Data Preprocessing: Before feeding the data into our model, we need to prepare it. We resize the images to a consistent size, rescale pixel values to a range between 0 and 1, and apply data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
>Model Architecture: Now, let's talk about the core of our solution, the neural network model. We define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. This architecture comprises Convolutional and MaxPooling layers that help our model automatically learn important features from the potato disease images.
>Training the Model: With the dataset ready and the model defined, we start the training process. We iterate through the dataset for 100 epochs, allowing our model to learn from the images. We also evaluate its performance on a separate validation dataset during training to monitor progress.
>Model Evaluation: After training, it's crucial to assess how well our model performs. We do this by evaluating its accuracy and loss on a dedicated test dataset. These metrics help us understand how effectively our model classifies potato diseases.
>Visualization: To gain further insights into the training process, we visualize the training history using matplotlib. This allows us to see how our model's accuracy and loss change over epochs, helping us make informed decisions about model tuning.
>Inference: Our code includes functions that enable us to make predictions on new potato disease images. This is where our trained model gets to shine, as it can now classify diseases in unseen images.
>Model Saving: To ensure we can use our trained model in the future without retraining it, we save it as a .h5 file. This file contains all the learned knowledge of our model.
>GitHub Integration: You can easily integrate this code into your GitHub repository, making it accessible to a broader community of developers and researchers for collaboration and further improvement.
>Tadaaaaaaa end!!!!!!!
